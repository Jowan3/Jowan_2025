**tools**

This is how i downloaded tools to set up my computer for vs code:
- i started by creating a github account
- then i installed kasm on to my computer 
    - which already has ubuntu and VS code 

- kasm started to have daily problems and i lost my repository so i moved on to my sisters Macbook

**restarted** 

- setted up and installed homebrew by following MacOS instructions 
- then i added the portfolio_2025 repository on to git hub 
    - created my own git hub repository Jowan_2025
- i set up git clone and venv 
    - venv shows up in my terminal but not in VS code for some reason
- installed txt requirements
- and began to enter in requirements from the nighthawk page into my terminal

**Creating my Webpage**

- created the navigation Jowan_2025 portfolio  
- then git cloned the repositroy onto vscode
- edited the about page to be about me and added the american flag
- added mario onto my home page
- added a page called tools which is where youre reading this 
    - it explains all the steps i did when crating this
- tried to add a button on the main page (didnt really work though)
